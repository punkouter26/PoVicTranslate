I didn\u0027t go because I had to go to night school that evening. So the next day he had a tape of what they did the night before. And that tape was an unfinished version of \u0022Protect Yo Neck.\u0022 When I heard that, everything just became crystal clear now. I never missed another studio session after that. Whenever he told me he was going somewhere I was there. It inspired me to sit down. Let me just see if I can write something. I\u0027ve never written a rhyme before this. So that\u0027s what I did.

But the problem was the business of Wu-Tang. They missed the photoshoot. The only photos they had, that I guess, featured them in masks. At the time, you know, this is pre-internet. If you missed the photoshoot, there was no way for a magazine to course correct. The magazine came out but instead of these photos, everybody had a basic, not even like an illustration, but a caricature. Raekwon the Chef, there was an illustration of Raekwon wearing like a chef hat. Ol\u0027 Dirty Bastard is pictured with a blow up doll. I didn\u0027t like \u0027em but the thing was-was I completely understood the position that they were put in. Without art we would have to kill the story. I didn\u0027t think the illustrations reflected the seriousness of what I witnessed. Cause musically Wu-Tang was just off the charts. I thought it looked corny. Some stories turn out great and some stories don\u0027t turn out great. This was the one I felt was only okay and um you move on. It came out and nothing happened. I didn\u0027t hear anything from the group\r\nFirst person that I see, Masta Killa walks up, I didn\u0027t know him at the time. And he say \u0022Yo, is you Cheo?\u0022 And I said \u0022Yeah.\u0022 Bam, I get hit in the face. He\u0027s right \u0027cross my left eye. \u0022That\u0027s just to let you know Wu-Tang Clan nothing to fuck with. We come real with our shit. We ain\u0027t no fuckin\u0027 cartoon characters.\u0022",
