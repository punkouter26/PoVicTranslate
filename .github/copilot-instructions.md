General Engineering Principles
Unified Identity: Use Po{SolutionName} as the master prefix for all namespaces, Azure Resource Groups, and Aspire resource names (e.g., PoTask1.API, rg-PoTask1-prod).
Global Cleanup: Actively delete unused files, dead code, or obsolete assets. Maintain a "zero-waste" codebase.
Directory.Build.props: Enforce <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors> and <Nullable>enable</Nullable> at the repository root to ensure all projects inherit strict safety standards.
Have /health endpoint on the server project that checks connections to all APIs and databases used
Context Management: Maintain a .copilotignore file to exclude bin/, obj/, and node_modules/, keeping AI focus on source logic.
Modern Tooling: Use Context7 MCP to fetch the latest SDKs and NuGet versions, ensuring the AI agent is working with up-to-date documentation.
Package Management: Use Central Package Management (CPM) via Directory.Packages.props with transitive pinning enabled.
Standard: Use DefaultAzureCredential for all environment-agnostic resource access.
Local Development: Primary secrets reside in dotnet user-secrets.
Cloud/Production: Use Azure Key Vault via Managed Identity.
Shared Resources: All keys/secrets are stored in the PoShared resource group in the Key Vault service; use these as a local fallback only if user-secrets are absent.

Use the Managed Identity as needed that is already in the PoShared resource group
Use Context7 MCP to verify latest versions of .NET and any nuget/npm packages
Create .http files that can be helpful for debugging API endpoints (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/http-files?view=aspnetcore-10.0)
Look in the Azure resource group PoShared for services to use
Looking into the Key Vault service contained in the resource group PoShared for Secrets and Keys 
Use Kay Vault when running code locally and in Azure




Create a set of 3 test project / Unit (C#)/ Integration (C#) /E2E (typescript)
.NET Unit Tests: Focus on pure logic and domain rules (High speed).
.NET Integration Tests: Target the API and Database. Use Testcontainers to spin up ephemeral SQL/Redis instances to verify real-world behavior.
Playwright E2E headless (TypeScript) (Chromium and mobile only):
Scope: Critical user paths only.
Constraints: Limit rendering to Chromium and Mobile.
Workflow: Run headed during development to verify functionality alongside the local server.
















App Stack: Blazor Web App + Aspire (Azure ACA Containers)
Template: Target .NET 10 Unified Blazor Web App (Server SSR + WASM Client).
Rendering Policy: Default to Static SSR. Elevate to InteractiveAuto only for specific components requiring low-latency responsiveness.
Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA): Organize by features, not layers. Group Endpoints, DTOs, and Logic within single, flattened feature folders.
Minimalist API: If the WASM client requires data, create minimal endpoints within the Server project. A separate API project is not required but instead the Server project will expose the services using .NET minimal APIs
Use OpenApi instead of Swashbuckle for API endpoint UI


Use Aspire CLI https://aspire.dev/get-started/install-cli/
Aspire First: Use .NET Aspire (AppHost and ServiceDefaults) for all local and cloud orchestration.
Service Discovery: Use Aspire project references; never hardcode ports or connection strings.
Telemetry: Enable OpenTelemetry (Logs, Traces, Metrics) globally, aggregating into Application Insights within the PoShared resource group.
Azd-Driven Infra: Use azd up to generate and deploy infrastructure (Azure Container Apps) directly from the Aspire model.
Po<solutionName> resource group in Azure should container a container app, table storage (if uses azure table storage)
PoShared will contain all other services needed and will have a key vault service for saving secrets as needed
