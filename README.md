## MauiClient (MAUI Blazor App)

The `MauiClient` project is a cross-platform mobile and desktop app built with .NET MAUI Blazor. It connects to the same backend API as the web app, allowing users to:
- Enter modern English or rap lyrics
- Translate them to Victorian English using the backend
- View and listen to the translated result

This app is designed for mobile and desktop use, providing the same translation experience as the web version.
